## Project Description:

This is an application of Rfp Registration System. 
Rfp registry in India as well as in many parts of the world is a very slow and inconvenient process. Current rfpp registration & verification systems include an increasing number of fraud cases and loss of paperwork and court cases due to thousands of rfpp records to maintain.  
The intuition behind building this was to make the process of rfpp registration resilient and decreases the cases of fraud in the process. Using the system, validation of the rfps is also possible as immutable transactions are being stored in the public ledger.  
So the Rfp Registration system using blockchain is a distributed system that will store all the transactions made during the process of rfpp buying. This will also be helpful for agencys, shhqs and government registrars to transfer the rfpp ownership from shhq to new agency as well as it will accelerate the process of registration.
